4. less <filename> --> Similar but faster than the more command
LISTING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:-
1. ls --> Lists the files in the current directory

5. ls --color --> Shows a coloured listing of all the files
6. ls -a --> Shows all the files in the present directory including the special dot files
COPYING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:-
1. cp <file1> <file2> --> Copies file 1 to file 2
2. cp <file1> <dirname> --> Copies file1 to Directory <dirname>3.
cp -r <dirname1> <dirname2> --> Copies dirname1 directory to directory dirname2
RENAMING FILES AND DIRECTORIES:-
1. mv <oldname> <newname> --> Renames file with old name to new name
2. mv <olddir> <newdir> --> Renames directory with name olddir to newdir
3. mv <filename> <dirname> --> Moves files with name as filename to directory

3. man -k <keyword> --> Searches for a command with a particular keywordIMPORTANT FILES IN LINUX:-
1. /bin # Essential user command and binary files
2. /boot # Static files of the boot loader
3. /dev # Device files
4. /etc # Host specific system configuration
5. /home # User home directories
6. /lib # Essential shared libraries and kernal modules
7. /mnt # Mount point for devices
8. /opt # Add on application software packages
