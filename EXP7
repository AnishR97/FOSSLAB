git help <command name>

4. CREATING A REPOSITORY
------------------------
1. Create a folder
2. cd into the folder and type 'git init'
3. Use the above local repository or create a repository on any sites such as github,bitbucket,gitlab etc

5. ADDING CONTENTS TO THE REPOSITORY 
-------------------------------------
git add .         -->This adds all the files to the local repository or the changed files to the local repository
git add <file>    -->To add a file to the local git repository

6. COMMITTING THE DATA INTO A REPOSITORY
-----------------------------------------
git commit -m "Message "  --> Message should be a string indicative of the changes made

7. ADDING A REMOTE
---------------------
git remote add origin <remote url> -->The git url obtained from the website

8. PUSHING CHANGES TO THE REMOTE SERVER

git push origin <branch name> --> This command uploads the changed source code to the remote server

9. COMPARING DIFFERENT REVISIONS
--------------------------------
1. git diff --> Shows the changes from the last commit and the uncommited changes
2. git diff commit1 commit 2 --> Shows the difference between two commits

10. REVERT
------------

git checkout <commitid> --> Switches to a previous point in the development

11. CONFLICTS
---------------
In the case of conflicts, there can be many cases 
1. You have uncommitted changes and you are trying to pull 
   Solution --> First commit your changes and then pull 
2. You are trying to push and you encounter an error
   Solution --> First pull and then push
3. You can't merge the current pull request
   --> This is because the same file has different status at the local and remote repositories
   Solution --> Change the conflicting file manually, then pull and later push 

12. BRANCHING
